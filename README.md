👨🏽‍💻 Hi! I am a university student who's been involved with technology, and more specifically, robotics, for over 8 years. I will be specializing in design and back-end development. I like to spend my time indulging in my hobbies, ranging from more physically demeanding activities such as football, or a relaxing sketching session. I'm also thoroughly involved in the community whether it be through clubs, hackathons, or volunteer activities!
